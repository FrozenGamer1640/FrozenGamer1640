## Hi!

I'm just another aspiring Vgen artist, I have experience with vectorial art and some time ago I also made pixelart animations (but not very good at it any more hehe). I also have programming as a hobby, I have experience with Godot, and I really love Nix tho, I'm also trying to get good at using Rust but not too much atm.
You can call me Fuyu, Fuyuka, Fuyu.nix or Fuyuka.nix if you want! (I'm Transfem and Pan with She/Her Pronouns btw hehe).

Fun fact, I have an Electron browser (Vieb) as my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE BROWSER not just bc It's designed fully around Vim motions, but for a funny reason, you see, when I was reading Its FAQ, I realized some things, I really hate that a big company forces me to do what they want me to do :)
